# Lede Hackathon

## Project Ideas:

#### 1. Problem: Reduce Motor Vehicle Collisions
- **Potential Data Sets:** [NYC Open Data on Motor Vehicle Collisions](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95), [NYC Street Centerline Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b), [NYC Sidewalk Features](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Sidewalk-Features/vfx9-tbb6)
- **Questions to address:**
	* Where is it most dangerous (intersections, neighborhoods, zip codes)?
	* When is it most dangerous (day of the week, time of day, weather conditions, etc.)?
	* What are the most frequent contributing causes of accidents? 
	* Do these answers vary in cases with injuries and fatalities?
- **What you need:**
	* An algorithm for predicting your target variable (which can vary, depending on how you frame the central question)
	* Data for every NYC intersection (maybe)
	* Feature data for every NYC intersection (maybe)
